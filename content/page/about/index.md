Hi, I'm Zheng Cheng (Knowckx), a senior software engineer with over 8 years of experience building robust, scalable solutions.

My core expertise lies in **Go** and **Python**, but I'm a **full-stack** developer at heart, comfortable with everything from cloud infrastructure and DevOps with **Kubernetes** to front-end development with **React** and **TypeScript**.

Throughout my career at companies like **SAP** and **NetEase Games**, I've led the development of critical systems—from high-traffic game features serving hundreds of thousands of daily players to infrastructure platforms that secured production environments and saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in cloud costs annually.

I'm driven by a strong sense of product ownership and a passion for turning ideas into reality. This led me to become an independent developer, where I now build my own products, such as an automated stock trading bot and open-source financial tools. I am a firm believer in continuous learning, leveraging AI to boost development efficiency, and sharing knowledge with the community.
